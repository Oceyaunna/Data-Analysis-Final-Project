I am working with a dataset from Kaggle about Video Game Sales over the Years 1983-2012. 
In this project I will take a closer look into the distribution of Video games over the years and Regional Sales

My dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/amalsalilan/uncovering-hidden-trends-in-the-video-game-industr/data?select=Video+Games+Sales.csv

#Project OverView

Part 1 is a description of your project and dataset link
Part 2 is EDA where I look at the shape and summary statistics of my data (look at the columns and check for nulls)
Part 3 is Cleaning the data. For this data set I specifically replaced some null values in the year columns with the corresponding correct year
Part 4 is a Tableau Data Story where I created visualizations to compare distributions in sales and amount of video games over time.
Part 5 is Statistical Modeling where I used linear regression to determine a relationship between European Sales and Years
